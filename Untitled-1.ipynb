    "## Info:\n",
    "    Creator: ( Mavor, Chris)\n",
    "    Date: (August 24, 2022)\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Usage: \n",
    "    The purpose of this script is to showcase usage of data extraction from API resource to develop datasets to perform statistical understanding of housing market as it relates to current company's geographic location.\n",
    "    This script performs a deeper learning and analysis of such data. This is following the data extraction from https://theexchange.fanniemae.com/ API. For more on that matter please refer back to \"01.Fannie API.ipynb\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Specific items that relate to company performance have been ommited to keep animinity and keep secure information from public knowledge.\n",
    "## Outline:\n",
    "    1. API Data requests:\n",
    "        Get the data\n",
    "    2. Data manipulation: \n",
    "        a. Parsing through json data array to create flat dataframe for each portion. \n",
    "        b. Gathering different metrics from different storage bins.\n",
    "    3. Storage: \n",
    "        After manipulation is completed, I am storing said information as a flat file for ease of further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps:\n",
    "    Following this data gathering, I use other methods for deeper learning on topics in which I have gathered here.\n"
